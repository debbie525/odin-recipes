        <h3>What is Basque Burnt Cheesecake?</h3>
        <p> Basque burnt cheesecake is a specialty dessert from the Basque region of Spain <br>
            Unlike American cheesecake, Basque cheesecake does not have a crust. <br>
            Basque burnt cheesecake comes out super dark and caramelized.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon soft unsalted butter, or as needed </li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened </li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
            <li>4 extra large eggs, at room temperature </li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li><br>
            <li>Butter a 9-inch cake pan. Cut a sheet of parchment paper large enough to line the<br>
                inside of the pan by a few extra inches. Butter the paper and press it into the pan, <br>
                flattening any major creases. Trim away any excess paper from the sides until you <br>
                have an inch or two of overhang.</li><br>
            <li>Combine cream cheese, sugar, salt, and flour in a bowl. Stir and smear together with <br>
                a spatula until very smooth and creamy. Add vanilla extract and 1 egg; whisk to <br>
                combine. Whisk in remaining eggs, one at a time. Pour in heavy cream and mix until <br>
                smooth.</li><br>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan. Tap the pan against the counter to burst any <br>
                excess air bubbles.
            </li><br>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffed, very well browned, and nearly burned on the ,<br>
                edges, 50 to 55 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) <br>
                in the last 10 minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>Let cheesecake cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes. Lift out onto a plate<br>
                and peel back parchment paper, using a knife or spatula if needed. Refrigerate until <br>
                thoroughly chilled, 4 hours to overnight.
